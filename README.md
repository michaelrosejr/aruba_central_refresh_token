To start, please login to Aruba Central and create an API System Token. Once done, download the token and save it as defualt.token.json

You'll also need to create a config.yml file. There's a sample.config.yml that you should use as a template. 

once done, run aruba_refresh_token and it will refresh your Aruba Central token and post the access_token and refresh_token on the scren.
